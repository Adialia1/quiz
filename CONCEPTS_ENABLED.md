## 📋 Final Step: Run Database SQL

**You need to run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor** (one time only):

```sql
-- Function to get concepts grouped by topic with counts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_concepts_by_topic()
RETURNS TABLE (
    topic TEXT,
    concept_count BIGINT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        concepts.topic,
        COUNT(*)::BIGINT as concept_count
    FROM concepts
    GROUP BY concepts.topic
    ORDER BY concepts.topic;
END;
$$;
```

**How to run:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Paste the SQL above
3. Click "Run"
